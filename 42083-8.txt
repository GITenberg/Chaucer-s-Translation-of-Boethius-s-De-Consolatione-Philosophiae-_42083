In the printed book, line numbers were squeezed in wherever there was
room. For the e-text, they have been regularized to the EETS-standard
multiples of 4. Line divisions and page numbers were retained for use
with the Index and linenotes, except that some very short words have
been moved up or down to avoid awkward gaps. Headnotes have been
moved to the nearest convenient line break.

Italics representing expanded abbreviations are shown in b{ra}ces.
Other italics are shown conventionally with _lines_. Superscripts are
shown with ^ (caret); they always continue to the end of the word.

In the Appendix, decorative final letters are shown with single + as
dar+, sprong+. Italic thorn (þ) and yogh ([gh]) seem to have been

In the primary text, anomalous spellings with initial "u" or non-initial
"v" are not individually noted. Other errors, whether corrected or not,

INTRODUCTION.


When master hands like those of Gibbon and Hallam have sketched the life
of _Boethius_, it is well that no meaner man should attempt to mar their
pictures. They drew, perhaps, the most touching scene in Middle-age
literary history,--the just man in prison, awaiting death, consoled by
the Philosophy that had been his light in life, and handing down to
posterity for their comfort and strength the presence of her whose
silver rays had been his guide as well under the stars of Fortune as the
mirk of Fate. With Milton in his dark days, Boece in prison could say,--

                                  'I argue not
  Against Heaven's hand or will, nor bate a jot
  Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer
  Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask?
  The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied
  In liberty's defence, my noble task,
  Of which all Europe rings from side to side.'

For, indeed, the echoes of Boethius, Boethius, rang out loud from every
corner of European Literature. An Alfred awoke them in England, a
Chaucer, a Caxton would not let them die; an Elizabeth revived them
among the glorious music of her reign.[I-1] To us, though far off, they
come with a sweet sound. 'The angelic' Thomas Aquinas commented on him,
and many others followed the saint's steps. Dante read him, though,
strange to say, he speaks of the Consolation as 'a book not known by
many.'[I-2] Belgium had her translations--both Flemish[I-3] and
French[I-4]; Germany hers,[I-5] France hers,[I-6] Italy hers.[I-7] The
Latin editors are too numerous to be catalogued here, and manuscripts
abound in all our great libraries.

No philosopher was so bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of
Middle-age writers as Boethius. Take up what writer you will, and you
find not only the sentiments, but the very words of the distinguished
old Roman. And surely we who read him in Chaucer's tongue, will not
refuse to say that his full-circling meed of glory was other than
deserved. Nor can we marvel that at the end of our great poet's life, he
was glad that he had swelled the chorus of Boethius' praise; and 'of the
translacioun of Boece de Consolacioun,' thanked 'oure Lord Ihesu Crist
and his moder, and alle the seintes in heuen.'

The impression made by Boethius on Chaucer was evidently very deep. Not
only did he translate him directly, as in the present work, but he read
his beloved original over and over again, as witness the following list,
incomplete of course, of passages from Chaucer's poems translated more
or less literally from the _De Consolatione_:

I. LOVE.

  Wost thou nat wel the olde clerkes sawe,
  That who schal yeve a lover eny lawe,
  Love is a grettere lawe, by my pan,
  Then may be yeve to (of) eny erthly man?

    (_Knightes Tale, Aldine Series_, vol. ii. p. 36, 37.)

  But what is he þat may [gh]eue a lawe to loueres. loue is a gretter
  lawe and a strengere to hym self þan any lawe þat men may [gh]euen.

    (_Chaucer's Prose Translation_, p. 108.)

  _Quis legem det amantibus?
  Major lex amor est sibi._

    (Boeth., lib. iii. met. 12.)


II. A DRUNKEN MAN.

  A dronke man wot wel he hath an hous,
  But he not[I-8] which the righte wey is thider.

    (_Knightes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 39.)

  _Ry[gh]t as a dronke man not nat[I-9] by whiche paþe he may retourne
  home to hys house._

    (Chaucer's Trans., p. 67.)

  _Sed velut ebrius, domum quo tramite revertatur, ignorat._

    (Boeth., lib. iii. pr. 2.)

    [Footnote I-8: The Harl. MS. reads _not nat_, to the confusion of
    the metre.]

    [Footnote I-9: = ne wot nat = knows not.]


III. THE CHAIN OF LOVE.

  The firste moevere of the cause above,
  Whan he first made the fayre cheyne of love,
  Gret was theffect, and heigh was his entente;
  Wel wist he why, and what therof he mente;
  _For with that faire cheyne of love he bond
  The fyr, the watir, the eyr, and eek the lond
  In certeyn boundes, that they may not flee._

    (_Knightes Tale_, p. 92.)

  That þe world with stable feith / varieth acordable chaungynges //
  þat the contraryos qualite of element[gh] holden amonge hem self
  aliaunce perdurable / þat phebus the sonne with his goldene
  chariet / bryngeth forth the rosene day / þat the mone hath
  commaundement ouer the nyhtes // whiche nyhtes hesperus the eue
  sterre hat[h] browt // þat þe se gredy to flowen constreyneth with
  a certeyn ende hise floodes / so þat it is nat l[e]ueful to
  strechche hise brode termes or bowndes vp-on the erthes // þat is
  to seyn to couere alle the erthe // Al this a-cordaunce of thinges
  is bownden with looue / þat gouerneth erthe and see / and [he]
  hath also commaundement[gh] to the heuenes / and yif this looue
  slakede the brydelis / alle thinges þat now louen hem to-gederes /
  wolden maken a batayle contynuely and stryuen to fordoon the
  fasoun of this worlde / the which they now leden in acordable
  feith by fayre moeuynges // this looue halt to-gideres poeples /
  ioygned with an hooly bond / and knytteth sacrement of maryages of
  chaste looues // And loue enditeth lawes to trewe felawes // O
  weleful weere mankynde / yif thilke loue þat gouerneth heuene
  gouerned yowre corages /.

    (_Chaucer's Boethius_, bk. ii. met. 8.)

  Quod mundus stabili fide
  Concordes variat vices,
  Quod pugnantia semina
  Foedus perpetuum tenent,
  Quod Phoebus roseum diem
  Curru provehit aureo,
  Ut quas duxerit Hesperus
  Phoebe noctibus imperet,
  Ut fluctus avidum mare
  Certo fine coerceat,
  Ne terris liceat vagis
  Latos tundere terminos;
  _Hanc rerum seriem ligat,
  Terras ac pelagus regens,
  Et coelo imperitans amor._
  Hic si fræna remiserit,
  Quicquid nunc amat invicem,
  Bellum continuo geret:
  Et quam nunc socia fide
  Pulcris motibus incitant,
  Certent solvere machinam.
  Hic sancto populos quoque
  Junctos foedere continet,
  Hic et conjugii sacrum
  Castis nectit amoribus,
  Hic fidis etiam sua
  Dictat jura sodalibus.
  O felix hominum genus,
  Si vestros animos amor,
  Quo cælum regitur, regat.

    (_Boeth._, lib. ii. met. 8.)

  Love, that of erth and se hath governaunce!
  Love, that his hestes hath in hevene hye!
  Love, that with an holsom alliaunce
  Halt peples joyned, as hym liste hem gye!
  Love, that knetteth law and compaignye,
  And couples doth in vertu for to dwelle!

    (_Troylus & Cryseyde_, st. 243, vol. iv. p. 296.)

  That, that the world with faith, which that is stable
  Dyverseth so, his stoundes concordynge;--
  That elementz, that ben so discordable,
  Holden a bond, perpetualy durynge;--
  That Phebus mot his rosy carte forth brynge,
  And that the mone hath lordschip overe the nyghte;--
  Al this doth Love, ay heryed be his myght!

  That, that the se, that gredy is to flowen,
  Constreyneth to a certeyn ende so
  Hise flodes, that so fiersly they ne growen
  To drenchen erth and alle for everemo;
  And if that Love aught lete his brydel go,
  Al that now loveth asonder sholde lepe,
  And lost were al that Love halt now to kepe.

    (_Ibid._ st. 244, 245.)


IV. MUTABILITY DIRECTED AND LIMITED BY AN IMMUTABLE AND DIVINE
INTELLIGENCE.

  That same prynce and moevere eek, quod he,
  Hath stabled, in this wrecched world adoun,
  Certeyn dayes and duracioun
  To alle that er engendrid in this place,
  Over the whiche day they may nat pace,
  Al mowe they yit wel here dayes abregge;
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  Than may men wel by this ordre discerne
  That thilke moevere stabul is and eterne.
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  And therfore of his wyse purveaunce
  He hath so wel biset his ordenaunce,
  That spices of thinges and progressiouns
  Schullen endure by successiouns
  And nat eterne be, withoute any lye.

    (_Knightes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 92, 93.)

  Þe engendrynge of alle þinges quod she and alle þe progressiouns
  of muuable nature. and alle þat moeueþ in any manere takiþ hys
  causes. hys ordre. and hys formes. of þe stablenesse of þe deuyne
  þou[gh]t [and thilke deuyne thowht] þat is yset and put in þe toure.
  þat is to seyne in þe hey[gh]t of þe simplicite of god. stablisiþ
  many manere gyses to þinges þat ben to don.

    (_Chaucer's Boethius_, bk. iv. pr. 6, p. 134.)


V. THE PART IS DERIVED FROM THE WHOLE, THE IMPERFECT FROM THE PERFECT.

  Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool,
  That every partye dyryveth from his hool.
  For nature hath nat take his bygynnyng
  Of no partye ne cantel of a thing,
  But of a thing that parfyt is and stable,
  Descendyng so, til it be corumpable.

    (_Knightes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 92.)

  For al þing þat is cleped inperfit . is proued inperfit by þe
  amenusynge of perfeccioun . or of þing þat is perfit . and her-of
  comeþ it . þat in euery þing general . yif þat . þat men seen any
  þing þat is inperfit . certys in þilke general þer mot ben somme
  þing þat is perfit. For yif so be þat perfeccioun is don awey .
  men may nat þinke nor seye fro whennes þilke þing is þat is cleped
  inperfit . For þe nature of þinges ne token nat her bygynnyng of
  þinges amenused and inperfit . but it procediþ of þingus þat ben
  al hool . and absolut . and descendeþ so doune in-to outerest
  þinges and in-to þingus empty and wiþ-oute fruyt . but as I haue
  shewed a litel her byforne . þat yif þer be a blisfulnesse þat be
  frele and vein and inperfit . þer may no man doute . þat þer nys
  som blisfulnesse þat is sad stedfast and perfit.'

    (bk. iii. pr. 10, p. 89.)

  Omne enim quod imperfectum esse dicitur, id deminutione perfecti
  imperfectum esse perhibetur. Quo fit ut si in quolibet genere
  imperfectum quid esse videatur, in eo perfectum quoque aliquod
  esse necesse sit. Etenim perfectione sublata, unde illud, quod
  imperfectum perhibetur, extiterit, ne fingi quidem potest. _Neque
  enim ab diminutis inconsummatisque natura rerum cepit exordium,
  sed ab integris absolutisque procedens in hæc extrema atque effoeta
  dilabitur._ Quod si, uti paulo ante monstravimus, est quædam boni
  fragilis imperfecta felicitas, esse aliquam solidam perfectamque
  non potest dubitari.

    (_Boeth._, lib. iii. pr. 10.)


VI. GENTILITY.

  For gentilnesse nys but renomé
  Of thin auncestres, for her heigh bounté
  Which is a straunge thing to thy persone.

    (_The Wyf of Bathes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 241.)

  For if þe name of gentilesse be referred to renoun and clernesse
  of linage. þan is gentil name but a foreine þing.

    (_Chaucer's Boethius_, p. 78.)

  _Quæ_ [nobilitas], _si ad claritudinem refertur, aliena est._

    (_Boethius_, lib. iii. pr. 6.)


VII. NERO'S CRUELTY.

  No teer out of his eyen for that sighte
  Ne cam; but sayde, a fair womman was sche.
  Gret wonder is how that he couthe or mighte
  Be domesman on hir dede beauté.

    (_The Monkes Tale_, vol. iii. p. 217.)

  Ne no tere ne wette his face, but he was so hard-herted þat he
  my[gh]te ben domesman or iuge of hire dede beauté.

    (_Chaucer's Boethius_, p. 55.)

  Ora non tinxit lacrymis, sed esse
  Censor extincti potuit decoris.

    (_Boethius_, lib. ii. met. 6.)


VIII. PREDESTINATION AND FREE-WILL.

In 'Troylus and Cryseyde' we find the following long passage taken from
Boethius, book v. prose 2, 3.

Book iv. st. 134, vol. iv. p. 339.

  (1) Syn God seth every thynge, out of doutaunce,
      And hem disponeth, thorugh his ordinaunce,
      In hire merites sothely for to be,
      As they shul comen by predesteyné

136

  (2) For som men seyn if God seth al byforne,
      Ne God may not deseyved ben pardé!
      Than moot it fallen, theigh men hadde it sworne,
      That purveyaunce hath seyn befor to be,
      Wherfor I seye, that, from eterne, if he
      Hathe wiste byforn our thought ek as oure dede,
      We have no fre choys, as thise clerkes rede.

137

  (3) For other thoughte, nor other dede also,
      Myghte nevere ben, but swich as purveyaunce,
      Which may nat ben deceyved nevere moo,
      Hath feled byforne, withouten ignoraunce;
      For if ther myghte ben a variaunce,
      To wrythen out fro Goddes purveyinge,
      Ther nere no prescience of thynge comynge;

138

  (4) But it were rather an opinyon
      Uncertein, and no stedfast forseynge;
      And certes that were an abusyon
      That God shold han no parfit clere wetynge,
      More than we men, that han douteous wenynge,
      But swich an erroure upon God to gesse
      Were fals, and foule, and wikked corsednesse.

139

  (5) They seyn right thus, that thynge is nat to come,
      For that the prescience hath seyne byfore
      That it shal come; but they seyn that therfore
      That it shal come, therfor the purveyaunce
      Woot it bifore, withouten ignorance.

140

  (6) And in this manere this necessité
      Retourneth in his part contrarye agayn;
      For nedfully byhoveth it not to be,
      That thilke thynges fallen in certeyn
      That ben purveyed; but nedly, as they seyne,
      Bihoveth it that thynges, which that falle,
      That thei in certein ben purveied alle.

141

  (7) I mene as though I labourede me in this,
      To enqueren which thynge cause of whiche thynge be;

  (8) As, whether that the prescience of God is
      The certein cause of the necessité
      Of thynges that to comen ben, pardé!
      Or, if necessité of thynge comynge
      Be cause certein of the purveyinge.

142

  (9) But now nenforce I me nat in shewynge
      How the ordre of causes stant; but wel woot I
      That it bihoveth that the bifallynge
      Of thynges, wiste bifor certeinly,
      Be necessarie, al seme it nat therby
      That prescience put fallynge necessaire
      To thynge to come, al falle it foule or faire.

143

 (10) For, if ther sit a man yonde on a see, [seat]
      Than by necessité bihoveth it,
      That certes thyn opinioun soth be,
      That wenest or conjectest that he sit;
      And, further over, now ayeinwarde yit,
      Lo right so is it on the part contrarie,
      As thus,--nowe herkene, for I wol nat tarie:--

144

 (11) I sey, that if the opinion of the
      Be soth for that he sit, than seye I this,
      That he moot sitten by necessité;
      And thus necessité in either is,
      For in hym nede of sittynge is, ywis,
      And in the, nede of soth; and thus forsoth
      Ther mot necessité ben in yow bothe.

145

 (12) But thow maist seyne, the man sit nat therfore,
      That thyn opinioun of his sittynge sothe is;
      But rather, for the man sat there byfore,
      Therfor is thyn opinioun soth, ywys;
      And I seye, though the cause of soth of this
      Cometh of his sittynge, yet necessité
      Is interchaunged both in hym and the.

146

 (13) Thus in the same wyse, out of doutaunce,
      I may wel maken, as it semeth me,
      My resonynge of Goddes purveiaunce,
      And of the thynges that to comen be; . . .

147

 (14) For although that for thynge shal come, ywys,
      Therfor it is purveyed certeynly,
      Nat that it cometh for it purveied is;
      Yet, natheles, bihoveth it nedfully,
      That thynge to come be purveied trewly;
      Or elles thynges that purveied be.
      That they bitiden by necessité.

148

 (15) And this sufficeth right ynough, certeyn,
      For to distruye oure fre choys everydele.

  (1) Quæ tamen ille ab æterno cuncta prospiciens providentiæ cernit
  intuitus, et suis quæque meritis prædestinata disponit. . . . .
  (_Boethius_, lib. v. pr. 2.)  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

  (2) Nam si cuncta prospicit Deus neque falli ullo modo potest,
  evenire necesse est, quod providentia futurum esse præviderit.
  Quare si ab æterno non facta hominum modo, sed etiam consilia
  voluntatesque prænoscit, nulla erit arbitrii libertas;

  (3) Neque enim vel factum aliud ullum vel quælibet existere
  poterit voluntas, nisi quam nescia falli providentia divina
  præsenserit. Nam si res aliorsum, quam provisæ sunt detorqueri
  valent, non jam erit futuri firma præscientia;

  (4) Sed opinio potius incerta; quod de Deo nefas credere judico.

  (5) Aiunt enim non ideo quid esse eventurum quoniam id providentia
  futurum esse prospexerit; sed e contrario potius, quoniam quid
  futurum est, id divinam providentiam latere non possit.

  (6) Eoque modo necessarium est hoc in contrariam relabi partem;
  neque enim necesse est contingere quæ providentur, sed necesse est
  quæ futura sunt provideri.

  (7) Quasi vero quæ cujusque rei causa sit,

  (8) Præscientiane futurorum necessitatis an futurorum necessitas
  providentiæ, laboretur.

  causarum, necessarium esse eventum præscitarum rerum, etiam si
  præscientia futuris rebus eveniendi necessitatem non videatur

  (10) Etenim si quispiam sedeat, opinionem quæ eum sedere conjectat

  necesse est. In utroque igitur necessitas inest: in hoc quidem
  sedendi, at vero in altero veritatis.

  (12) Sed non idcirco quisque sedet, quoniam vera est opinio: sed
  hæc potius vera est, quoniam quempiam sedere præcessit. Ita cum
  causa veritatis ex altera parte procedat, inest tamen communis in
  utraque necessitas.

  (13) Similia de providentia futurisque rebus ratiocinari patet.

  (14) Nam etiam si idcirco, quoniam futura sunt, providentur: non

  vel ventura provideri, vel provisa evenire necesse est:

IX. THE GRIEF OF REMEMBERING BYGONE HAPPINESS.

  The worste kynde of infortune is this,
  A man to han ben in prosperité,
  And it remembren, when it passed is.

  adversitate fortunæ infelicissimum genus est infortunii, fuisse
  felicem.[I-10]

In book v., stanza 260, vol. v. p. 75, Chaucer describes how the soul of
Hector, after his death, ascended 'up to the holughnesse of the seventhe
spere.' In so doing he seems to have had before him met. 1, book 4, of
Boethius, where the 'soul' is described as passing into the heaven's
utmost sphere, and looking down on the world below. See _Chaucer's
Boethius_, p. 110, 111.

Ætas Prima is of course a metrical version of lib. ii. met. 5.

Hampole speaks of the wonderful sight of the Lynx; perhaps he was
indebted to Boethius for the hint. --(See _Boethius_, book 3, pr. 8,
p. 81.)

Chaucer did not English Boethius second-hand, through any early French
version, as some have supposed, but made his translation with the Latin
original before him.

Jean de Méung's version, the only early French translation, perhaps,
accessible to Chaucer, is not always literal, while the present
translation is seldom free or periphrastic, but conforms closely to the
Latin, and is at times awkwardly literal. A few passages, taken
haphazard, will make this sufficiently clear.

Many of the above examples are very bald renderings of the original, and
are only quoted here to show that Chaucer did not make his translation
from the French.

Chaucer is not always felicitous in his translations:--thus he
translates _clavus atque gubernaculum_ by _keye and a stiere_ (p. 103),
and _compendium_ (gain, acquisition) by _abreggynge_ (abridging,
curtailment), p. 151. Many terms make their appearance in English for
the first time,--and most of them have become naturalized, and are such
as we could ill spare. Some few are rather uncommon, as _gouernaile_
(gubernaculum), p. 27; _arbitre_ (arbitrium), p. 154. As Chaucer takes
the trouble to explain _inestimable_ (inæstimabilis), p. 158, it could
not have been a very familiar term.

Our translator evidently took note of various readings, for on p. 31 he
notes a variation of the original. On p. 51 he uses _armurers_
(= armures) to render _arma_, though most copies agree in reading
_arva_.

There are numerous glosses and explanations of particular passages,
which seem to be interpolated by Chaucer himself. Thus he explains what
is meant by the _heritage of Socrates_ (p. 10, 11); he gives the
meaning of _coemption_ (p. 15); of _Euripus_ (p. 33); of the _porch_
(p. 166).[I-11] Some of his definitions are very quaint; as, for
instance, that of Tragedy--'_a dité of a prosperité for a tyme þat endiþ
in wrechednesse_' (p. 35). One would think that the following definition
of Tragedian would be rather superfluous after this,--'_a maker of dites
þat hy[gh]ten_ (are called) _tregedies_' (p. 77).

  _Melliflui . . . oris Homerus_

is thus quaintly Englished: _Homer wiþ þe hony mouþe, þat is to seyn.
homer wiþ þe swete dites_ (p. 153).

       *       *       *       *       *

The present translation of the _De Consolatione_ is taken from
Additional MS. 10,340, which is supposed to be the _oldest_ manuscript
that exists in our public libraries. After it was all copied out and
ready for press, Mr Bradshaw was kind enough to procure me, for the
purpose of collation, the loan of the Camb. University MS. Ii. 3. 21,
from which the various readings at the foot of the pages are taken.

Had I had an opportunity of examining the Cambridge MS. carefully
throughout before the work was so far advanced, I should certainly have
selected it in preference to the text now given to the reader. Though
not so ancient as the British Museum MS., it is far more correct in its
grammatical inflexions, and is no doubt a copy of an older and very
accurate text.

The Additional MS. is written by a scribe who was unacquainted with the
force of the final _-e_. Thus he adds it to the preterites of strong
verbs, which do not require it; he omits it in the preterites of weak
verbs where it is wanted, and attaches it to passive participles (of
weak verbs), where it is superfluous. The scribe of the Cambridge MS. is
careful to preserve the final _-e_ where it is a sign (1) of the
definite declension of the adjective; (2) of the plural adjective;
(3) of the infinitive mood; (4) of the preterite of weak verbs; (5) of
present participles;[I-12] (6) of the 2nd pers. pret. indic. of strong
verbs; (7) of adverbs; (8) of an older vowel ending.

The Addit. MS. has frequently _thilk_ (singular and plural), and _-nes_
(in _wrechednes_, &c.), when the Camb. MS. has _thilke_[I-13] and
_-nesse_.

For further differences the reader may consult the numerous collations
at the foot of the page.

If the Chaucer Society obtains that amount of patronage from the
literary public which it deserves, but unfortunately has yet not
succeeded in getting, so that it may be enabled to go on with the great
work which has been so successfully commenced, then the time may come
when I shall have the opportunity of editing the Camb. MS. of Chaucer's
Boethius for that Society, and lovers of Early English Literature will
have two texts instead of one.

APPENDIX TO INTRODUCTION.


The last of the ancients, and one who forms a link between the classical
period of literature and that of the middle ages, in which he was a
favourite author, is Boethius, a man of fine genius, and interesting
both from his character and his death. It is well known that after
filling the dignities of Consul and Senator in the court of Theodoric,
he fell a victim to the jealousy of a sovereign, from whose memory, in
many respects glorious, the stain of that blood has never been effaced.
The _Consolation of Philosophy_, the chief work of Boethius, was written
in his prison. Few books are more striking from the circumstances of
their production. Last of the classic writers, in style not impure,
though displaying too lavishly that poetic exuberance which had
distinguished the two or three preceding centuries, in elevation of
sentiment equal to any of the philosophers, and mingling a Christian
sanctity with their lessons, he speaks from his prison in the swan-like
tones of dying eloquence. The philosophy that consoled him in bonds, was
soon required in the sufferings of a cruel death. Quenched in his blood,
the lamp he had trimmed with a skilful hand gave no more light; the
language of Tully and Virgil soon ceased to be spoken; and many ages
were to pass away, before learned diligence restored its purity, and the
union of genius with imitation taught a few modern writers to surpass in
eloquence the Latinity of Boethius. --(Hallam's _Literature of Europe_,
i. 2, 4th ed. 1854.)

The Senator Boethius is the last of the Romans whom Cato or Tully could
have acknowledged for their countryman. As a wealthy orphan, he
inherited the patrimony and honours of the Anician family, a name
ambitiously assumed by the kings and emperors of the age; and the
appellation of Manlius asserted his genuine or fabulous descent from a
race of consuls and dictators, who had repulsed the Gauls from the
Capitol, and sacrificed their sons to the discipline of the Republic. In
the youth of Boethius the studies of Rome were not totally abandoned; a
Virgil is now extant, corrected by the hand of a consul; and the
professors of grammar, rhetoric, and jurisprudence, were maintained in
their privileges and pensions by the liberality of the Goths. But the
erudition of the Latin language was insufficient to satiate his ardent
curiosity; and Boethius is said to have employed eighteen laborious
years in the schools of Athens, which were supported by the zeal, the
learning, and the diligence of Proclus and his disciples. The reason and
piety of their Roman pupil were fortunately saved from the contagion of
mystery and magic, which polluted the groves of the Academy, but he
imbibed the spirit, and imitated the method, of his dead and living
masters, who attempted to reconcile the strong and subtle sense of
Aristotle with the devout contemplation and sublime fancy of Plato.
After his return to Rome, and his marriage with the daughter of his
friend, the patrician Symmachus, Boethius still continued, in a palace
of ivory and [glass] to prosecute the same studies. The Church was
edified by his profound defence of the orthodox creed against the Arian,
the Eutychian, and the Nestorian heresies; and the Catholic unity was
explained or exposed in a formal treatise by the _indifference_ of three
distinct though consubstantial persons. For the benefit of his Latin
readers, his genius submitted to teach the first elements of the arts
and sciences of Greece. The geometry of Euclid, the music of Pythagoras,
the arithmetic of Nicomachus, the mechanics of Archimedes, the astronomy
of Ptolemy, the theology of Plato, and the logic of Aristotle, with the
commentary of Porphyry, were translated and illustrated by the
indefatigable pen of the Roman senator. And he alone was esteemed
capable of describing the wonders of art, a sun-dial, a water-clock, or
a sphere which represented the motions of the planets. From these
abstruse speculations, Boethius stooped, or, to speak more truly, he
rose to the social duties of public and private life: the indigent were
relieved by his liberality; and his eloquence, which flattery might
compare to the voice of Demosthenes or Cicero, was uniformly exerted in
the cause of innocence and humanity. Such conspicuous merit was felt and
rewarded by a discerning prince: the dignity of Boethius was adorned
with the titles of consul and patrician, and his talents were usefully
employed in the important station of master of the offices.
Notwithstanding the equal claims of the East and West, his two sons were
created, in their tender youth, the consuls of the same year. On the
memorable day of their inauguration, they proceeded in solemn pomp from
their palace to the forum amidst the applause of the senate and people;
and their joyful father, the true Consul of Rome, after pronouncing an
oration in the praise of his royal benefactor, distributed a triumphal
largess in the games of the circus. Prosperous in his fame and fortunes,
in his public honours and private alliances, in the cultivation of
science and the consciousness of virtue, Boethius might have been styled
happy, if that precarious epithet could be safely applied before the
last term of the life of man.

A philosopher, liberal of his wealth and parsimonious of his time, might
be insensible to the common allurements of ambition, the thirst of gold
and employment. And some credit may be due to the asseveration of
Boethius, that he had reluctantly obeyed the divine Plato, who enjoins
every virtuous citizen to rescue the state from the usurpation of vice
and ignorance. For the integrity of his public conduct he appeals to the
memory of his country. His authority had restrained the pride and
oppression of the royal officers, and his eloquence had delivered
Paulianus from the dogs of the palace. He had always pitied, and often
relieved, the distress of the provincials, whose fortunes were exhausted
by public and private rapine; and Boethius alone had courage to oppose
the tyranny of the Barbarians, elated by conquest, excited by avarice,
and, as he complains, encouraged by impunity. In these honourable
contests his spirit soared above the consideration of danger, and
perhaps of prudence; and we may learn from the example of Cato, that a
character of pure and inflexible virtue is the most apt to be misled by
prejudice, to be heated by enthusiasm, and to confound private enmities
with public justice. The disciple of Plato might exaggerate the
infirmities of nature, and the imperfections of society; and the mildest
form of a Gothic kingdom, even the weight of allegiance and gratitude,
must be insupportable to the free spirit of a Roman patriot. But the
favour and fidelity of Boethius declined in just proportion with the
public happiness; and an unworthy colleague was imposed to divide and
control the power of the master of the offices. In the last gloomy
season of Theodoric, he indignantly felt that he was a slave; but as his
master had only power over his life, he stood without arms and without
fear against the face of an angry Barbarian, who had been provoked to
believe that the safety of the senate was incompatible with his own. The
Senator Albinus was accused and already convicted on the presumption of
_hoping_, as it was said, the liberty of Rome.

"If Albinus be criminal," exclaimed the orator, "the senate and myself
are all guilty of the same crime. If we are innocent, Albinus is equally
entitled to the protection of the laws." These laws might not have
punished the simple and barren wish of an unattainable blessing; but
they would have shown less indulgence to the rash confession of
Boethius, that, had he known of a conspiracy, the tyrant never should.
The advocate of Albinus was soon involved in the danger and perhaps the
guilt of his client; their signature (which they denied as a forgery)
was affixed to the original address, inviting the emperor to deliver
Italy from the Goths; and three witnesses of honourable rank, perhaps of
infamous reputation, attested the treasonable designs of the Roman
patrician. Yet his innocence must be presumed, since he was deprived by
Theodoric of the means of justification, and rigorously confined in the
tower of Pavia, while the senate, at the distance of five hundred miles,
pronounced a sentence of confiscation and death against the most
illustrious of its members. At the command of the Barbarians, the occult
science of a philosopher was stigmatized with the names of sacrilege and
magic. A devout and dutiful attachment to the senate was condemned as
criminal by the trembling voices of the senators themselves; and their
ingratitude deserved the wish or prediction of Boethius, that, after
him, none should be found guilty of the same offence.

While Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment the
sentence or the stroke of death, he composed in the tower of Pavia the
_Consolation of Philosophy_; a golden volume not unworthy of the leisure
of Plato or Tully, but which claims incomparable merit from the
barbarism of the times and the situation of the author. The celestial
guide, whom he had so long invoked at Rome and Athens, now condescended
to illumine his dungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his
wounds her salutary balm. She taught him to compare his long prosperity
and his recent distress, and to conceive new hopes from the inconstancy
of fortune. Reason had informed him of the precarious condition of her
gifts; experience had satisfied him of their real value; he had enjoyed
them without guilt; he might resign them without a sigh, and calmly
disdain the impotent malice of his enemies, who had left him happiness,
since they had left him virtue. From the earth, Boethius ascended to
heaven in search of the SUPREME GOOD; explored the metaphysical
labyrinth of chance and destiny, of prescience and free-will, of time
and eternity; and generously attempted to reconcile the perfect
attributes of the Deity with the apparent disorders of his moral and
physical government. Such topics of consolation, so obvious, so vague,
or so abstruse, are ineffectual to subdue the feelings of human nature.
Yet the sense of misfortune may be diverted by the labour of thought;
and the sage who could artfully combine in the same work the various
riches of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, must already have possessed
the intrepid calmness which he affected to seek. Suspense, the worst of
evils, was at length determined by the ministers of death, who executed,
and perhaps exceeded, the inhuman mandate of Theodoric. A strong cord
was fastened round the head of Boethius, and forcibly tightened till his
eyes almost started from their sockets; and some mercy may be discovered
in the milder torture of beating him with clubs till he expired. But his
genius survived to diffuse a ray of knowledge over the darkest ages of
the Latin world; the writings of the philosopher were translated by the
most glorious of the English kings, and the third emperor of the name of
Otho removed to a more honourable tomb the bones of a Catholic saint,
who, from his Arian persecutors, had acquired the honours of martyrdom
and the fame of miracles. In the last hours of Boethius, he derived some
comfort from the safety of his two sons, of his wife, and of his
father-in-law, the venerable Symmachus. But the grief of Symmachus was
indiscreet, and perhaps disrespectful; he had presumed to lament, he
might dare to revenge, the death of an injured friend. He was dragged in
chains from Rome to the palace of Ravenna; and the suspicions of
Theodoric could only be appeased by the blood of an innocent and aged
senator.--Gibbon's _Decline and Fall_, 1838, vol. vii. p. 45-52 (without
the notes).

    [Sidenote: But if this supreme good is in Him by nature, and is
    nevertheless of a different substance, we cannot conceive, since
    God is the author of all things, what could have united these two

    [Sidenote: _P._ As you grant that happiness is a good, you may say
    the same of all the other goods; for perfect sufficiency is
    identical with supreme felicity; so is supreme power, likewise
    high rank, a shining reputation, and perfect pleasure.]

    they cannot be more desirable than the good itself.]

    [Sidenote: _P._ In the animal creation as long as the soul and the

    [Sidenote: Herbs and trees first choose a convenient place to grow
    in, where, agreeably to their respective natures, they are sure to
    thrive, and are in no danger of perishing; for some grow on
    plains, some on mountains, &c.; and if you try to transplant them,
    they forthwith wither and die.]

    [Sidenote: The discordant elements of this world would never have
    assumed their present form unless there had been a wise

    joining of such opposites would have disunited and ruined the

    [Sidenote: _B._ It cannot be gainsaid.]

          þat may nat ben denied q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ I have shown that God is the chief good; God must,
    therefore, direct and order all things by _good_, since he governs
    them by himself, whom we have proved to be the _supreme good_, and
    he is that helm and rudder, by which this machine of the world is

    [Sidenote: _P._ I believe it; for your eyes are now more intent
    upon these great truths relating to true felicity; but what I am
    going to say is not less open to your view.]

          I trowe it wel q{uo}d she. ¶ For as

    [Sidenote: _P._ As we believe that God governs all things by his

    the will and control of their ruler?]

    the absolute Ruler of all things is goodness itself, evil exists
    and is allowed to pass unpunished.]

    [Sidenote: But the power of doing evil has no relation to that
    Good, therefore it is not desirable; but as all power is
    desirable, it is clear that the ability to do evil is not power.]

    [Sidenote: Since, then, each of these three things (_i. e._ the

    [Sidenote: _P._ You think rightly; but if you cannot assent to my

    [Sidenote: _P._ That the wicked who have been punished for their

    unpunished.]

    [Sidenote: I do not appeal to popular arguments, that punishment
    corrects vice, that the fear of chastisement leads them to take
    the right path, and that the sufferings of evil-doers deter others

    more unhappy in another way.]

    [Sidenote: _P._ If good be added to the wretchedness of a man,

    be annexed, does not he become more wretched than he whose misery

    [Sidenote: _P._ When evil men are punished they have a degree of
    good annexed to their wretchedness, to wit, the punishment itself,
    which as it is the effect of justice is good.]

    [Sidenote: And when these wretches escape punishment something
    more of ill (_i. e._ exemption from punishment) is added to their

  whiche defaute of peyne þou hast graunted is yuel.

    [Sidenote: _B._ I cannot deny it.]

  ¶ For þe desert of felonye I ne may nat denye it q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ Much more unhappy are the wicked when they enjoy
    an unmerited impunity than when they suffer a lawful
    chastisement.]

          but my conseil nys nat to determyne
  of þis peyne. but I haue trauayled and told it
  hider to.

    [Sidenote: I want you to see that the power of the wicked is in
    reality nothing, that the wicked never go unpunished; that their
    licence to do evil is not of long duration, and that the wicked
    would be more unhappy if it were longer, and infinitely wretched
    if it were to continue for ever.]

          ¶ For þou sholdest knowe þat þe mowynge

  {and} most vnsely yif þei weren p{er}durable.

    [Sidenote: After this I showed that evil men are more unhappy,
    having escaped punishment, than if justly chastised.]

          {and} after
  þis I haue shewed þe þat more vnsely ben shrewes

    they suffer most grievously.]

    [Sidenote: _P._ It is so. For those accustomed to the darkness of

    like birds of night which are blinded by the full light of day.]

    and beyond the movement of Destiny.]

    round which the outward ones revolve;]

    [Sidenote: whilst the outermost, revolving in a wider
    circumference, the further it is from the centre describes a
    larger space--but yet, if this circle or anything else be joined
    to the middle point, it is constrained to be immovable.]

    [Sidenote: _B._ How?]

          ¶ In whiche manere
  q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ So often as a man does anything for the sake of
    any other thing, and another thing than what he intended to do is
    produced by other causes, that thing so produced is called
    _Chance_.]

          ¶ As ofte q{uo}d she as men don any þing for
  grace of any oþer þing. {and} an oþer þinge þan þilke             4344

    [Sidenote: As if a man trench the ground for tillage and find
    gold, then this is believed to happen by chance, although it is
    not so.]

          ¶ Ry[gh]t as a man dalf þe erþe by
  cause of tylienge of þe felde. {and} fond þere a gobet of   [[pg 151]]

  bytydyng. but for soþe it nis nat for nau[gh]t for
  it haþ hys p{ro}pre causes of whiche causes þe cours vnforseyn
  and vnwar semiþ to han maked hap{pe}.

    [Sidenote: For if the tiller had not ploughed the field, and if
    the hider of the gold had not concealed it in that spot, the gold
    had not been found.]

          ¶ For
  yif þe tilier in þe erþe ne delue nat in þe felde. and yif        4352
  þe hider of þe golde ne hadde hidd þe golde in þilke
  place. þe golde ne had[de] nat ben founde.

    [Sidenote: These, then, are the causes of a fortuitous acquisition
    which proceeds from a conflux of encountering causes, and not from
    the intention of the doer.]

          þise ben

    [Sidenote: For neither the hider of the gold nor the husbandman
    intended or understood that the gold should be found.]

          ¶ For neiþer þe hider of þe gold.
  ne þe deluer of þe felde ne vndirstanden nat þat þe
  golde sholde han be founde. but as I seide.

    [Sidenote: But it happened by the concurrence of these two causes
    that the one did dig where the other had hidden the money.]

          it bytidde                                                4360
  {and} ran to-gidre þat he dalf þere as þat oþer hadde hidd
  þe golde.

    [Sidenote: Chance, then, is an unexpected event, by a concurrence
    of causes, following an action designed for a particular purpose.]

          Now may I þus diffinissen hap{pe}. ¶ Hap{pe}

    [Sidenote: But I will prove that, however the order of causes may
    stand, the event of things foreseen is necessary, although
    prescience doth not seem to impose a necessity upon future things
    to fall out.]

          ¶ But I ne enforce me nat now

    [Sidenote: For if a man sit--the belief in the sitting is true;

    [Sidenote: In both cases there is a necessity--in the latter that
    the person sits--in the former, that the opinion concerning the
    other is true.]

          ¶ þan
  is here necessite in þat oon {and} in þ{a}t oþer. for in þat      4484

    [Sidenote: But the man does not sit because the opinion of his
    sitting is true, but the opinion is true because the action of his
    being seated was antecedent in time.]

    [Sidenote: For allowing things are foreseen because they are to
    happen, and that they do not befall because they are foreseen, it
    is necessary that future events should be foreseen of God, or if
    foreseen that they should happen; and this alone is sufficient to
    destroy all idea of _free-will_.]

    imagining that God foresees future events because they are to
    happen.]

          ¶ But now                                                 4500

    [Sidenote: Say what discordant cause looses the bonds of things?]

  ++What discordable cause haþ to-rent {and} vnioigned þe
  byndyng or þe alliaunce of þinges. þat is to seyne
  þe coniuncc{i}ou{n} of god {and} of man.

    [Sidenote: What power doth make these two great truths (_i. e._
    Providence and Free-will) contend, which when separate are plain
    and clear, but united appear dark and perplexed?]

          ¶ whiche god
  haþ establissed so grete bataile bitwixe{n} þise two soþefast     4608
  or verray þinges. þat is to sein bytwixen þe p{ur}ueaunce

  coupled to-gidre. but þer nis no discorde to [tho] verray         4612
  þinges. but þei cleuen certeyne al wey to hem self.

    [Sidenote: The mind of man encumbered by the earthly body, can
    never, with her cloudy sight, discover the subtle and close bonds
    of things.]

  but þe þou[gh]t of man co{n}founded {and} ouerþrowen by þe dirke

  þe soule is in þe body knowen þe þinne subtil knyttynges
  of þinges.

    [Sidenote: But why does man burn with ardour to learn the hidden
    notes of truth?]

          ¶ But wherfore eschaufiþ it so by so
  grete loue to fynden þilke note[s] of soþe y-cou{er}ed. (_glosa_)
  þat is to sein wherfore eschaufiþ þe þou[gh]t of man by so        4620

  vndir þe couerto{ur}s of soþe.

    [Sidenote: Why gropes he for he knows not what? None seek to know
    what is known.]

          woot it ou[gh]t þilke þinges
  þat it anguissous desireþ to knowe. as who seiþ nay.        [[pg 160]]
  ¶ For no man ne trauaileþ forto witen þinges þat he woot.         4624
  {and} þerfore þe texte seiþ þus. ¶ [_Glosa_] Si eni{m} a{n}i{m}a

  ¶ But who traua[i]leþ to wyten þinges y-knowe.

    [Sidenote: If he knows them not, what does he so blindly seek?]

          and yif                                                   4628

    [Sidenote: Who wishes for things he hath never known?]

          what is he þat desireþ any þinge of whiche he
  woot ry[gh]t nat. as who seiþ who so desiriþ any þing
  nedis som what he knoweþ of it. or ellys he ne couþe              4632

  ywist

    [Sidenote: Or if he seek, where shall he find them? Or if he find,
    how shall he be sure that he has found what he sought for?]

          ¶ and þou[gh] [þ{a}t] he seke þo þinges where shal
  he fynde{n} hem. what wy[gh]t þat is al vnknowynge {and}
  ignoraunt may knowe þe forme þat is yfounde.

    [Sidenote: The pure soul that sees the divine thought, knows all
    the secret chains of things.]

          ¶ But                                                     4636
  whan þe soule byholdeþ {and} seeþ þe heye þou[gh]t. þat is

  singularites. þat is to seyn þe p{r}inciples {and} eueryche
  by hym self.

    [Sidenote: Yet, though now hidden in its fleshly members, it hath
    some remembrance of its pure state--it retains the sums of things,
    but has lost their particulars.]

          ¶ But now while þe soule is hidd in þe                    4640

  it ne haþ nat al for[gh]eten it selfe. but it wiþholdeþ þe
  so{m}me of þinges {and} lesiþ þe singularites.

    [Sidenote: He who seeks truth is not in either circumstance
    (_i. e._ seeking for what he knows or knows not), he knoweth not
    all things, nor hath he wholly forgotten all.]

          þan who so

  he not nat alle ne he ne haþ nat alle for-[gh]eten.

    [Sidenote: But he ponders on what he knows, that he may add those
    things that he hath forgotten to those that he retains.]

          ¶ But

    ANSWERS TO OBJECTIONS AGAINST PROVIDENCE.]

TAMEN ILLA UETUS INQ{U}IT HEC EST.

  [Sidenote: [The 4^the p{ro}se.]]

    [Sidenote: _P._ This is the old objection against Providence, so
    ably handled by Cicero in his _Book of Divination_; and you
    yourself have anxiously discussed it.]

  ++Þanne seide she. þis is q{uo}d she þe olde questiou{n} of

  outerly {and} lo{n}g[e].

    [Sidenote: But neither of you have offered a satisfactory solution
    of the difficulty.]

          but [gh]it ne haþ it nat ben determined                   4656
  ne yspedd fermely {and} diligently of any of yow.

    [Sidenote: The cause of this mystery is that the human
    understanding cannot conceive the simplicity of the divine
    prescience, for if it were possible to comprehend this, every
    difficulty would at once disappear.]

  ¶ And þe cause of þis derkenesse {and} [of this] difficulte
  is for þat þe moeuynge of þe resou{n} of mankynde ne
  may nat moeue{n} to. þat is to sein applien or ioygnen to         4660
  þe simplicite of þe deuyne p{re}science. ¶ þe whiche
  symplicite of þe deuyne p{re}science [gh]if þat men [myhten

    [Sidenote: I ask, then, why you do not approve the reasoning of
    such as think--that Prescience does not obstruct the liberty of
    the will, because it is not the necessitating cause of future
    events?]

    NECESSITY AND PRESCIENCE.]

    [Sidenote: Do you draw an argument of the necessity of future
    events, from any other topic than this,--that those things which
    are foreknown must of necessity happen?]

  for ne drawest þou nat argumentes from ellys
  where of þe necessite of þinges to comen. As who seiþ             4676
  any oþer wey þan þus. but þat þilke þinge[s] þat þe p{re}scie{n}ce
  woot byforn [ne] mowen nat vnbitide. þat is to
  seyn þat þei moten bitide.

    [Sidenote: If divine prescience imposes no necessity upon future
    things, must not the issue of things be voluntary, and man's will
    free and unconstrained?]

          ¶ But þan yif þat p{re}science
  ne putteþ no necessite to þinges to comen. as þou þi self         4680
  hast confessed it {and} byknowen a litel herbyforn{e}.
                  ¶ what                                      [[pg 162]]

  by whiche þat þe endes (exitus) uoluntarie of þinges
  my[gh]ten be constreyned to certeyne bitydyng.

    [Sidenote: For argument sake let us suppose there is no
    prescience, would, then, the events which proceed from free-will
    alone be under the power of necessity?]

          ¶ For                                                     4684
  by grace of possessiou{n}. so þat þou mowe þe better vndirstonde

  necessite.

    [Sidenote: _B._ No.]

          {Boici}us. nay q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ Let us, then, admit Prescience, but that it
    imposes no necessity on what is to happen; the freedom of the will
    would still remain entire and absolute.]

          þan a[gh]einward q{uo}d
  she. I suppose þat þere be p{re}science but þat ne putteþ
  no necessite to þinges. þan trowe I þat þilk self fredom          4692
  of wille shal dwelle{n} al hool {and} absolut {and} vnbounden.

    [Sidenote: But although Prescience, you may say, is not the
    necessary cause of future events, yet it is a sign that they shall
    necessarily happen, and hence it follows that, although there were
    no prescience, future events would still be an inevitable
    necessity.]

  but þou wolt sein þat al be it so þat p{re}science
  nis nat cause of þe necessite of bitidynge to þinges to
  comen. ¶ Algates [gh]itte it is a signe þ{a}t þe þinges ben       4696

  bitydynges of þinges to come{n} sholde ben necessarie.            4700

    [Sidenote: For the sign of a thing is not really the thing itself,
    but only points out what the individual is.]

  ¶ For euery sygne sheweþ {and} signifieþ oonly what þe
  þing is ¶ but it ne makiþ nat þe þing þat it signifieþ.

    [Sidenote: Wherefore, it must be first proved that everything
    happens by necessity before we can conclude that prescience is a
    sign of that necessity.]

  ¶ For whiche it byhoueþ firste to shewen þat no þing
  ne bitidiþ [þ{a}t it ne bytydith] by necessite. so þat it         4704

    [Sidenote: We see many things when they are done before our eyes;

  of oure eyen or of oure sy[gh]t.

    [Sidenote: _P._ The things, then, which are done are under no
    necessity that they should be done; then first before they were
    done, they were under no necessity of coming to pass; wherefore
    some things happen, the event of which is unconstrained by
    necessity.]

    THE NATURE OF TRUE KNOWLEDGE.]

    [Sidenote: If things are foreknown, you may contend they must
    necessarily happen; and if their event is not necessary, they
    cannot be foreseen, because true knowledge can comprehend nothing
    but what is absolutely certain.]

  ¶ For certys þei seme to discorde. for þou
  wenest þat yif þat þinges ben yseyn byforn þat necessite
  folweþ hem. and yif ({et} putas) necessite faileþ hem þei ne      4748
  my[gh]ten nat ben wist byforn. {and} þat no þinge ne may
  ben comp{re}hendid by science but certeyne.

    [Sidenote: And if things uncertain in their events are foreseen as
    certain, this knowledge is nothing more than a false opinion.]

          {and} yif þo
  þinges þat ne han no certeyne bytidynges ben ypurueied
  as certeyn.

    [Sidenote: For it is very remote from true knowledge to judge of
    things otherwise than they really are.]

    [Sidenote: The cause of this error is that men imagine that their
    knowledge is wholly derived from the nature of the things known,
    whereas it is quite the reverse.]

  cause of þis errour is. þat of alle þe þinges þat euery           4756

    but by the faculties of the observer.]

    SENSE, REASON, AND INTELLIGENCE.]

    [Sidenote: Man himself is surveyed in divers ways--by the senses,
    by the imagination, by reason, and by the intelligence (of the
    Deity).]

  ¶ and þe man hym self oþer weies wyt byholdiþ hym. {and}
  oþ{er}weyes ymaginac{i}ou{n} {and} oþer weyes resou{n}. {and}     4772
  oþer weyes intelligence.

    [Sidenote: The senses take note of his material figure--the
    imagination considers the form alone, exclusive of the matter.]

          ¶ For þe wit co{m}p{re}he{n}diþ

  [comp{re}hendith only the figur{e} w{i}t{h} owte the mater{e} /   4776

    [Sidenote: Reason transcends the imaginations, and examining
    existences in general discovers the particular species, but the
    eye of Intelligence soars still higher; for, going beyond the
    bounds of what is general, it surveys the _simple forms_
    themselves, by its own pure and subtle thought:]

  Resou{n} surmou{n}teth ymaginaciou{n}]
                  {and} co{m}p{re}hendeþ                      [[pg 165]]

  is hey[gh]er for it so{ur}mou{n}teþ þe envirounynge of þe         4780
  vniu{er}site {and} lookeþ ouer þat by pure subtilite of þou[gh]t.

    [Sidenote: in which this is chiefly to be considered, that the
    higher power of perception embraces the lower; but the inferior
    cannot attain to the energy of the superior:]

  þilk same symple forme of man þat is p{er}durably in þe
  deuyne þou[gh]t. in whiche þis au[gh]t[e] gretely to ben considered

  lower{e} strengthe ne arysith nat in no maner{e} to heyer{e}
  strengthe].

    [Sidenote: for the senses cannot go beyond the perception of
    matter; the imagination cannot comprehend existences in general,
    nor can the reason conceive the simple form.]

          for wit ne may no þinge co{m}p{re}hende oute of

  speces. ne resou{n} ne takeþ nat þe symple forme. so as
  i{n}telligence takeþ it.

    [Sidenote: But the Intelligence looking down (as from above) and
    having conceived the form, discerns all things that are below it,
    and comprehends what does not fall within the reach of the other
    faculties of the mind.]

          but þe intelligence þat lokeþ al
  abouen whan it haþ co{m}p{re}hendid þe forme it knoweþ

  non of þo þre forseide strengþes of þe soule.

    [Sidenote: Without the aid of those faculties Intelligence
    comprehends things _formally_ (_i. e._ by beholding their simple
    forms) by one effort of mind.]

          for it                                                    4796

    [Sidenote: Reason, without the aid of Imagination and Sense, in
    considering things in general, comprehends all imaginable and
    sensible things.]

  ne it ne vseþ nat nor of resou{n} ne of ymaginac{i}ou{n} ne

    [Sidenote: For instance, reason defines her general conceptions
    thus:--]

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 37 _b_.]]

          for resou{n} is she þat *diffinisseþ þe vniuersel         4808
  of hir conseite ry[gh]t þus.                                [[pg 166]]

    [Sidenote: Man is a rational two-footed animal, which, though it
    be a general idea, yet every one knows that man thus defined is
    perceived both by the imagination and the senses, notwithstanding
    that in this instance reason does not make use of imagination or
    the senses, but of her own rational conception.]

          ¶ Man is a resonable t[w]o-footid

  resou{n}. but þat nis nat by ymaginac{i}ou{n}. nor by witte.
  but it lokiþ it by [a] resonable concepc{i}ou{n}.

    [Sidenote: The imagination also, although it derives its power of
    seeing and forming figures from the senses, yet in the absence and
    without the use of the senses it considers and comprehends all
    sensible things by its own imaginative power.]

          ¶ Also ymaginac{i}ou{n}

  alle þinges sensible. nat by resou{n} sensible of demynge.
  but by resou{n} ymaginatif.

    [Sidenote: Do not you see that men attain to the knowledge of
    things more by their own faculties, than by the inherent property
    of things?]

          ¶ sest þou nat þan þat alle

    [Sidenote: Nor is it unreasonable that it should be so--for since
    every judgment is the act of the person judging; every one must
    needs do his own work by the help of his own faculties, and not by
    the aid of foreign power.]

    [Sidenote: When God knows that anything is to be, he knows at the

    not conjecture, but certain knowledge founded upon truth.]

    [Sidenote: If you insist that _what God foresees shall and must
    happen; and that which cannot do otherwise than happen, must needs
    happen_, and so bind me to admit a necessity, I must confess that
    things are under such a restraint; but it is a truth that we
    scarce can comprehend, unless we be acquainted with the Divine
    counsels.]

    happen in relation to the Divine knowledge is necessary; but,
    considered in its own nature, seems free and absolute.]

          ¶ for I wol answer{e} þe þus. þat þilke

enquere forto witen yif þat any swiche manere goode as þilke goode þat
þou hast diffinissed a lytel her byforne. þat is to seine souereyne

nis ry[gh]t as a welle of alle goodes. ¶ For al þing þat is cleped
i{n}p{er}fit. is proued i{n}p{er}fit by þe amenusynge of

þat in euery þing general. yif þat. þat men seen any þing þat is

þinke nor seye fro whe{n}nes þilke þing is þat is cleped inperfit. ¶ For
þe nature of þinges ne token nat her bygynnyng of þinges amenused {and}

god. it may nat ben douted þan þat [he þ{a}t] no þing is bettre. þat he
nys good. ¶ Certys resou{n} sheweþ þat god is so goode þat it p{ro}ueþ
by verray force þat p{er}fit goode is in hym. ¶ For yif god ne is
swiche. he ne may nat ben p{r}ince of alle þinges. for certis som þing
possessyng in hy{m} self p{er}fit goode sholde ben more þan god. {and}
[it] sholde seme þat þilke þing were first {and} elder þan god. ¶ For we
han shewed ap{er}tly þat alle þinges þat ben p{er}fit. ben first or
þinges þat ben inperfit. ¶ And for þi for as moche as [that] my resou{n}
or my p{ro}ces ne go nat awey wiþoute an ende. we ou[gh]t[e] to graunten
þat þe souereyne god is ry[gh]t ful of souereyne p{er}fit goode. and we
han establissed þat þe souereyne goode is verrey blisfulnesse. þan mot
it nedes ben [þ{a}t verray blysfulnesse is] yset i{n} souereyne god.
_B._ þis take I wel q{uo}d .I. ne þis ne may nat be wiþseid in no
manere. ¶ But I p{re}ie þe q{uo}d she see now how þou mayst preuen
holily {and} wiþ-oute{n} corrupciou{n} þis þat I haue seid. þat þe
souereyne god is ry[gh]t ful of souereyne goode. [In whych man{er}e
q{uo}d I.] wenest þou ou[gh]t q{uo}d she þat þis p{r}ince of alle þinges
haue ytake þilke souereyne good any where þan of hym self. ¶ of whiche
souereyne goode men p{ro}ueþ þat he is ful ry[gh]t as þou my[gh]test
þinken. þat god þat haþ blisfulnesse in hym self. {and} þat ilke
blisfulnesse þat is in hym were diu{er}s in substaunce. ¶ For yif þou
wene þat god haue receyued þilke good oute of hy{m} self. þou mayst wene
þat he þat [gh]af þilke good to god. be more goode þan is god. ¶ But I
am byknowen {and} confesse {and} þat ry[gh]t dignely þat god is ry[gh]t
worþi abouen alle þinges. ¶ And yif so be þat þis good be in hym by
nature. but þat it is diu{er}s from [hym] by wenyng resou{n}. syn we
speke of god p{r}ince of alle þinges feyne who so feyne may. who was he
þat [hath] co{n}ioigned þise diu{er}s þinges to-gidre. {and} eke at þe
last[e] se wel þat o þing þat is diu{er}s from any þing. þat þilke þing
nis nat þat same þing. fro whiche it is vndirstonde{n} to ben diu{er}s.
þan folweþ it. þat þilke þi{n}g þat by hys nature is dyuers from
souereyne good. þat þat þing nys nat souereyne good. but certys þat were
a felonous corsednesse to þinken þat of hym. þat no þing nis more worþe.
For alwey of alle þinges. þe nat{ur}e of hem ne may nat ben better þan
his bygy{n}nyng. ¶ For whiche I may concluden by ry[gh]t uerray
resou{n}. þat þilke þat is bygynnyng of alle þinges. þilke same þing is
good in his substaunce. _B._ þou hast seid ry[gh]tfully q{uo}d .I. _P._
But we han graunted q{uo}d she þat souereyne good is blysfulnes. þat is
soþe q{uo}d .I. þan q{uo}d she mote we nedes graunten {and} confessen
þat þilke same souereyne goode be god. ¶ Certys q{uo}d .I. I ne may nat
denye ne wiþstonde þe resou{n}s p{ur}posed. and I see wel þat it folweþ
by strengþe of þe p{re}misses. ¶ Loke nowe q{uo}d she yif þis be proued
[yit] more fermely þus. ¶ þat þer ne mowen nat ben two souereyne goodes
þat ben diuerse amo[n]ges hem self. þat on is nat þat þat oþer is. þan
[ne] mowen neiþer of hem ben p{er}fit. so as eyþer of hem lakkiþ to
oþir. but þat þat nis nat p{er}fit men may seen apertly þat it nis nat
souereyne. þe þinges þan þat ben souereynely goode ne mowen by no wey
ben diuerse. ¶ But I haue wel conclude þat blisfulnesse {and} god ben
[the] souereyne goode. For whiche it mot nedes be þat souereyne
blisfulnesse is souerey[ne] dyuynite. ¶ No þing q{uo}d I nis more
soþefast þan þis ne more ferme by resou{n}. ne a more worþi þing þan god
may nat ben concluded. _P._ vpon þise þinges þan q{uo}d she. ry[gh]t as
þise geometriens whan þei han shewed her p{ro}posiciou{n}s ben wont to
brynge{n} in þinges þat þei clepen porismes or declarac{i}ou{n}s of
forseide þinges. ry[gh]t so wil I [gh]eue þe here as a corolarie or a
mede of coroune. For whi. for as moche as by þe getynge of blisfulnesse
men ben maked blysful. {and} blisfulnesse is diuinite. ¶ þan is it
manifest {and} open þat by þe gety{n}g of diuinite men ben makid
blisful. ry[gh]t as by þe getynge of iustice . . . {and} by þe getyng of
sapience þei ben maked wise. ¶ Ry[gh]t so nedes by þe semblable resou{n}
wha{n} þei han getyn diuinite þei ben maked goddys. þan is euery blisful
man god. ¶ But certis by nature. þer nys but oon god. but by þe
p{ar}ticipac{i}ou{n}s of diuinite þere ne letteþ ne disturbeþ no þing
þat þer ne ben many goddes. ¶ þis is q{uo}d .I. a faire þing {and} a
p{re}cious. ¶ Clepe it as þ{o}u wolt. be it corolarie or porisme or mede
of coroune or declarynges ¶ Certys q{uo}d she no þing nis fairer. þan is
þe þing þat by resou{n} sholde ben added to þise forseide þinges. what
þing q{uo}d .I. ¶ So q{uo}d she as it semeþ þat blisfulnesse conteniþ
many þinges. it were forto witen wheþir [þ{a}t] alle þise þinges maken
or conioignen as a maner body of blysfulnesse by diuersite of parties or
[of] me{m}bris. Or ellys yif any of alle þilke þi{n}g{us} be swyche þat
it acomplise by hy{m} self þe substaunce of blisfulnesse. so þat alle
þise oþer þinges ben referred and brou[gh]t to blisfulnesse. þat is to

clerly to vndirstonde what þou seist. {and} þat þou recordest me þe
forseide þinges. ¶ Haue I nat iuged q{uo}d she. þat blisfulnesse is

q{uo}d she þilke goode þat is maked blisfulnes to alle þe forseide
þinges. ¶ For þilke same blisfulnesse þat is demed to ben souereyne
suffisaunce. þilke self is souereyne power. souereyne reuerence.
sou{er}eyne clernesse or noblesse {and} souereyne delit. what seist þou
þan of alle þise þinges. þat is to seyne. suffisance power {and} þise
oþer þinges. ben þei þan as membris of blisfulnesse. or ben þei referred
{and} brou[gh]t to souereyne good. ¶ Ry[gh]t as alle þinges þat ben
brou[gh]t to þe chief of hem. b. I vndirstonde wel q{uo}d .I. what þou
p{ur}posest to seke. but I desijr[e] to herkene þat þou shewe it me.
_p._ Take now þus þe discressiou{n} of þis questiou{n} q{uo}d she. yif
al þise þinges q{uo}d she weren membris to felicite. þan weren þei
diu{er}se þat oon fro þat oþer. ¶ And swiche is þe nat{ur}e of p{ar}ties
or of membris. þat dyuerse me{m}bris compounen a body. ¶ Certis q{uo}d I
it haþ wel ben shewed her byforne. þat alle þise þinges ben alle on
þing. þan ben þei none membris q{uo}d she. for ellys it sholde seme þat
blisfulnesse were conioigned al of one membre alone. but þat is a þi{n}g
þat may nat ben doon. þis þing q{uo}d .I. nys nat doutous. but I abide
to herkene þe remenaunt of þe questiou{n}. þis is ope{n} {and} clere
q{uo}d she. þat alle oþer þinges ben referred {and} brou[gh]t to goode.
¶ For þerfore is suffisaunce requered. For it is demed to ben good.
{and} forþi is power requered. for men trowen also þat it be goode. and
þis same þing mowe we þinken {and} coueiten of reuerence {and} of
noblesse {and} of delit. þan is souereyne good þe soume {and} þe cause
of alle þat au[gh]t[e] be desired. forwhi þilke þing þat wiþ-holdeþ no
good in it self ne semblaunce of goode it ne may nat wel in no manere be
desired ne requered. {and} þe contrarie. For þou[gh] þat þinges by hir
nature ne ben nat goode algates yif men wene þat þei be{n} goode [gh]it
ben þei desired as þou[gh] [þ{a}t] þei were verrayly goode. {and}
þerfore is it þat men au[gh]te{n} to wene by ry[gh]t þat bounte be
souereyne fyn {and} þe cause of alle þinges þat ben to requeren. ¶ But
certis þilke þ{a}t is cause for whiche men requeren any þing. ¶ it semeþ
þat þilke same þing be most desired. as þus yif þat a wy[gh]t wolde ryde
for cause of hele. he ne desireþ nat so mychel þe moeuyng to ryden as þe
effect of his heele. Now þan syn þat alle þinges ben requered for þe
grace of good. þei ne ben [nat] desired of alle folk more þan þe same
good ¶ But we han graunted þat blysfulnesse is þat þing for whiche þat
alle þise oþer þinges ben desired. þan is it þus þat certis only
blisfulnesse is requered {and} desired ¶ By whiche þing it sheweþ
clerely þat good {and} blisfulnesse is al oone {and} þe same substaunce.
¶ I se nat q{uo}d I wher fore þat men my[gh]t[en] discorden in þis. _p._
{and} we han shewed þat god {and} verrey blysfulnesse is al oon þing
¶ þat is soþe q{uod} .I. þan mowe we conclude sikerly þ{a}t þe

philosophre [the moore excellent by me]. þe adu{er}sites comen nat (he
seide in grec[;]) þere þ{a}t uertues han edified þe bodie of þe holy
man. and ofte tyme it bitideþ þat þe so{m}me of þinges þat ben to don is
taken to good folk to gouerne. for þat þe malice habundaunt of shrewes
sholde ben abatid. {and} god [gh]eueþ {and} dep{ar}tiþ to oþer folk

ben trauayled wiþ harde þinges. ¶ For þat þei sholden conferme þe

and oþer folke dreden more þen þei au[gh]ten þe wiche þei my[gh]t[en]

þat aduersite comeþ some tyme to shrewes. {and} some tyme þat þei

shrewes þe to{ur}ment som tyme agasteþ oþer to done folies. {and} som

þat is [gh]euen to shrewes sheweþ a grete argument to good[e] folk what
þing þei sholde demen of þilk wilfulnesse þe whiche p{ro}sperite men

¶ For so as þer nis none alyaunce bytwixe good[e] folke {and} shrewes.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
